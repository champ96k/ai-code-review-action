# AI Code Review GitHub Action

A GitHub Action that automatically reviews pull requests using Google's Gemini AI. This action analyzes code changes and provides intelligent feedback directly on your pull requests.

## Features

- ü§ñ Automated code review using Google's Gemini AI
- üìù Detailed feedback on code changes
- üîÑ Runs automatically on pull requests
- üéØ Configurable to run on specific branches
- üîí Secure handling of API keys

## Usage

### Basic Setup

Create a new file `.github/workflows/ai_review.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Champ AI Code Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
    branches:
      - master  # Only run on PRs targeting master branch

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  ai_review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run AI Code Review
        uses: champ96k/ai-code-review-action@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          google_api_key: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_API_KEY }}
```

### Required Secrets

1. `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
2. `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key
   - Get it from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Add it in your repository settings under Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

### Configuration Options

The action accepts the following inputs:

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `github_token` | Yes | GitHub token for accessing PR details |
| `google_api_key` | Yes | Google Gemini API key for AI analysis |

## How It Works

1. When a pull request is created or updated, the action automatically triggers
2. It fetches the code changes from the PR
3. Sends the changes to Google's Gemini AI for analysis
4. Posts the AI's review as a comment on the PR

## Example Output

The action will post a comment on your PR that looks like this:

```
‚úÖ LGTM!
```

Or if there are issues:

```
Here are some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consider adding error handling in the data processing function
2. The variable naming could be more descriptive
3. Missing documentation for the new API endpoint
```
